# 📂 Spring Boot REST API Practice Project

This repository contains my practice work created while learning **Spring Boot** and building **REST APIs**.
In this project, I implemented a complete backend structure using layered architecture to understand how real-world applications are designed.

---

## 📚 About

The purpose of this project is to learn how backend systems work — from handling HTTP requests to interacting with the database — using Spring Boot.

I followed a proper **industry-style project structure** including Controller, Service, Repository, DTO, Entity, and Configuration layers.

---

## 🧱 Project Architecture

This project follows the layered architecture:

* **Controller Layer** → Handles client HTTP requests & responses
* **Service Layer** → Contains business logic
* **Service Implementation (Impl)** → Actual implementation of services
* **Repository Layer** → Database communication using JPA
* **Entity Layer** → Database table mapping
* **DTO Layer** → Data transfer between layers (Request/Response models)
* **Config Layer** → Application configurations
* **Main Application Class** → Runs the Spring Boot application
